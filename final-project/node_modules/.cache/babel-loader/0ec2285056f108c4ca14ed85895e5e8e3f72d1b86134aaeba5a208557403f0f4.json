Heat radiation (IR spectrum) is the highest in perpendicular direction to the surface so in a standard radiator, every fin is radiating its heat at a neighboring fin, keeping more heat in the element.

Angle cutting provides three major benefits. 1- increased overall surface of the radiator by 40% vs standard cutting methods. 2- significantly greater airflow compared to traditional radiators that increases convective heat dissipation 3 –most importantly, 45deg angle cutting makes all the surfaces radiate the heat away from the brake pad. Heat radiation (IR spectrum) is the highest in perpendicular direction to the surface so in a standard radiator, every fin is radiating its heat at a neighboring fin, keeping more heat in the element. Our pads radiate all the heat away from the back plate.<br />\r\n                                        </li>\r\n                                        <li>To date, Graphenpads® are the only brake pads in the market that completely eliminate toxic copper, ahead of new regulations (copper brake dust is proven to be toxic to aquatic life hence new California regulation will ban use of copper from 2025)<br />\r\n                                        </li>\r\n                                        <li>Extraordinary lifespan of the brake pads and rotors.
